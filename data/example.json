    "Post": "I'm in a well paid job. I have beautiful friends, and most of the best ones are women. I'm finally at a point in my life where I feel safe, have come to terms with the past, am able to give time and money to help others. And yet despite all these blessings I've been paralysed for the last week, unable to function at work. By a lie."
    "Reasoning": "**Stimulus**: The individual mentions \"a lie\" as the stimulus that has caused their paralysis and inability to function at work.\n\n2. **Evaluation**: The lie is likely evaluated as \"harmful.\" Despite the positive aspects of their life, the impact of the lie is causing distress, which suggests it has negative effects on their emotional state.\n\n3. **Reaction**: The individual expresses feelings of paralysis and inability to function, indicating significant emotional turmoil. Phrases like \"paralysed for the last week\" suggest a profound emotional response, likely characterized by feelings of stress, anxiety, or overwhelm despite existing blessings.\n\n4. **Stress state**: Given that the individual feels unable to function because of the harmful impact of the lie, we can infer that they are experiencing a stress response. Therefore, the result is \"stressed.\"

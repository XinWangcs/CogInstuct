    "Post": "I'm in a well paid job. I have beautiful friends, and most of the best ones are women. I'm finally at a point in my life where I feel safe, have come to terms with the past, am able to give time and money to help others. And yet despite all these blessings I've been paralysed for the last week, unable to function at work. By a lie.",
    "Reasoning": "1. **Stimulus**: The individual mentions \"a lie\" as the stimulus that has caused their paralysis and inability to function at work.\n\n2. **Evaluation**: The lie is likely evaluated as \"harmful.\" Despite the positive aspects of their life, the impact of the lie is causing distress, which suggests it has negative effects on their emotional state.\n\n3. **Reaction**: The individual expresses feelings of paralysis and inability to function, indicating significant emotional turmoil. Phrases like \"paralysed for the last week\" suggest a profound emotional response, likely characterized by feelings of stress, anxiety, or overwhelm despite existing blessings.\n\n4. **Stress state**: Given that the individual feels unable to function because of the harmful impact of the lie, we can infer that they are experiencing a stress response. Therefore, the result is stressed.",

    "Post": "She treated me like a freaked-out horse. It was clearly effective. Today, my marriage is different. My wife doesn't rely on me near as much as she did; she looks after her own affairs (poor wording, lol). She also doesn't ask for my opinion on very many things, even though she previously wanted my input on almost everything.",
    "Reasoning": "1. **Stimulus**: The treatment received by the individual, specifically the comparison to a \"freaked-out horse.\" \n\n2. **Evaluation**: irrelevant. The individual appears to have detached from the emotional implications of the comparison, viewing it as a reflection of the dynamics in the relationship rather than a personal affront.\n\n3. **Reaction**: The statement \"it was clearly effective\" suggests a level of acceptance or resignation regarding the changes in the marriage. The individual is observing a shift where their wife is taking on more autonomy, indicating a pragmatic response rather than a deeply emotional one. Despite the initial discomfort from being treated in a dismissive way, the overall tone reflects an understanding of the relationship's evolution without intense emotional distress.\n\n4. **Stress state**: non-stressed. While there is a recognition of discomfort, the individual seems to be adapting to the changes in their relationship, indicating a lack of significant stress regarding the situation.",

    "Post": "I need to see that list. I can not make a decision based on evidence I can not see. Please include that list as evidence. I very much want to see it.",
    "Reasoning": "1. **Stimulus:** The request for access to the list.\n\n2. **Evaluation:** irrelevant (The individual's expression reflects a desire for information rather than a negative emotional response. They are focused on obtaining the list to make a decision, but their tone suggests that this is part of a normal decision-making process.)\n\n3. **Reaction:** seeks clarification and expresses a strong need for information; maintains composure while articulating the request.\n\n4. **Stress state:** non-stressed (The individual is actively seeking information and is not displaying signs of emotional distress or pressure related to the situation.)",
